Outputs of BIDSonym
-------------------

BIDSonym generates three broad classes of outcomes:

  1. **Visual QA (quality assessment) reports**:
     one :abbr:`HTML (hypertext markup language)` per subject,
     that allows the user a thorough visual assessment of the quality
     of de-identification and ensures the transparency of ``BIDSonym`` operation.

  2. **imaging data** including defaced images in the `BIDS root` directory and
     non-defaced images in the `sourcedata/bidsonym` directory.

  3. **sidecar JSON and metadata .tsv files** including de-identified files in the `BIDS root`
     directory and not de-identified files in the `sourcedata/bidsonym` directory.


Visual Reports
--------------

``BIDSonym`` outputs summary reports, written to ``sourcedata/bidsonym/sub-<subject_label>/sub-<subject_label>.html``.
These reports provide a quick way to make visual inspection of the de-identification easy.
`View a sample report. <_static/sample_report.html>`_ (This sample report includes data from one of the maintainers
(Peer Herholz) who provided the data and agreed to sharing it.)
It includes information on the version ``BIDSonym`` that was run and how it was run.
Furthermore, multiple graphics each displaying the whole ``defaced image`` in 10 slices along different
directions (x,y,z) are included. To evaluate if the ``defacing`` was too stringent, a ``brainmask`` created before
the ``defacing`` is overlaid. The reports additionally include a gif within which the ``defaced image`` is scrolled
through each direction. 

Imaging data
------------

Regarding ``Imaging data`` two types of outputs will be created when running ``BIDSonym``:

copied non-defaced images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The non-defaced images that enter ``BIDSonym`` as input will be copied
to ``sourcedata/bidsonym/sub-<subject_label>/`` and provide with a ``no_deid``
identifier in their filename. For example:
``bids_dataset/sub-<subject_label>/anat/sub-<subject_label>_T1w.nii.gz``
will be copied and renamed to
``bids_dataset/sourcedata/bidsonym/sub-<subject_label>/sub-<subject_label>_T1w_no_deid.nii.gz``.
This step is intended to keep the ``non-defaced images`` in case the defacing did not succeed (for
example too much or too little information cut out), so that users can copy the non-defaced images
back to the ``bids_dataset`` directory and do not need to convert the non-defaced images from ``DICOM``
again.


`and`


defaced images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The images of either a specified participant or the whole group (depending on the ``analysis_level parameter``, please see `Usage <./usage.rst>`_)
in the ``bids_dataset`` will be defaced via the specified defacing algorithm (please see `Usage <./usage.rst>`_).
Neither the data structure nor the filenames will be changed. For example:
``bids_dataset/sub-<subject_label>/anat/sub-<subject_label>_T1w.nii.gz`` will be defaced, overwriting
the input image, so that the ``bids_dataset`` directory contains only de-identified data which then
can be entered into a processing pipeline and/or publicly shared (once again, depending on the regulations
of the country you're in and/or acquired the data in).




Sidecar JSON and metadata .tsv files
------------------------------------

Regarding ``Sidecar JSON and metadata .tsv files`` three types of outputs will be created when running ``BIDSonym``:


metadata .tsv files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``BIDSonym`` will access both the information stored in the ``header`` of the images and ``sidecar JSON files``, writing them
to ``.tsv`` files with two columns: 1. the type of information and 2. if it might be problematic in terms of data sharing. By default,
all information is considered to not be problematic, but the user can provide a list of strings for which will be searched
in the extracted information via the ``--check_meta_data`` argument. If a certain string, e.g., ``name`` or ``location`` is found,
the respective field is marked as ``yes`` in the ``problematic`` column.
Thus users can investigate and evaluate if potentially sensitive information is present in the data and, if not done already, indicate
metadata fields which information should be deleted through the ``--del_meta`` argument. However, only metadata from the
``sidecar JSON files`` but not the ``image headers`` will be deleted.


copied non-de-identified sidecar JSON files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Comparable to the ``non-defaced images``, the ``non-de-identified
sidecar JSON files`` will be copied to ``sourcedata/bidsonym/sub-<subject_label>/``
and provided with a ``no-deid`` identifier. Here's an example:
``bids_dataset/sub-<subject_label>/anat/sub-<subject_label>_T1w.json``
will be copied and renamed to
``bids_dataset/sourcedata/sub-<subject_label>/anat/sub-<subject_label>_T1w_no_deid.json``.
This step is intended to keep the ``non-de-identified
sidecar JSON files`` in case the de-identification did not succeed , so that users can copy
the ``non-de-identified sidecar JSON files``
back to the ``bids_dataset`` directory and do not need to do run the conversion again.
Please not that while de-facing only targets ``structural data``, the ``sidecar JSON files``
of all modalities will be included.


de-identified sidecar JSON files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If set by the user through the ``--del_meta`` argument, ``BIDSonym`` will deleted
the value of indicated ``metadata fields`` in the ``sidecar JSON files`` within the
``bids_dataset`` directory, replacing them with the string ``deleted_by_bidsonym``.
For example, if the ``metadata field`` ``InstitutionAddress`` should be deleted,
the respective value of the ``sidecar JSON files`` will change from e.g.,
``InstitutionAddress : 'A restaurant at the end of the Universe.'``  to
``InstitutionAddress : 'deleted_by_bidsonym'``.
