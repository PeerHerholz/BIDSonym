	abstract = {Due to the increasing need for subject privacy, the ability to deidentify structural {MR} images so that they do not provide full facial detail is desirable. A program was developed that uses models of nonbrain structures for removing potentially identifying facial features. When a novel image is presented, the optimal linear transform is computed for the input volume (: Neuron 33:341–355; : Neuroimage 23 (Suppl 1):S69–S84). A brain mask is constructed by forming the union of all voxels with nonzero probability of being brain and then morphologically dilated. All voxels outside the mask with a nonzero probability of being a facial feature are set to 0. The algorithm was applied to 342 datasets that included two different T1-weighted pulse sequences and four different diagnoses (depressed, Alzheimer’s, and elderly and young control groups). Visual inspection showed none had brain tissue removed. In a detailed analysis of the impact of defacing on skull-stripping, 16 datasets were bias corrected with N3 (: {IEEE} Trans Med Imaging 17:87–97), defaced, and then skull-stripped using either a hybrid watershed algorithm (: Neuroimage 22:1060–1075, in {FreeSurfer}) or Brain Surface Extractor (: {IEEE} Trans Med Imaging 16:41–54; : Neuroimage 13:856–876); defacing did not appreciably influence the outcome of skull-stripping. Results suggested that the automatic defacing algorithm is robust, efficiently removes nonbrain tissue, and does not unduly influence the outcome of the processing methods utilized; in some cases, skull-stripping was improved. Analyses support this algorithm as a viable method to allow data sharing with minimal data alteration within large-scale multisite projects.},

	title = {Quickshear defacing for neuroimages},
	abstract = {Data sharing offers many benefits to the neuroscience research community. It encourages collaboration and interorganizational research efforts, enables reproducibility and peer review, and allows meta-analysis and data reuse. However, protecting subject privacy and implementing {HIPAA} compliance measures can be a burdensome task. For high resolution structural neuroimages, subject privacy is threatened by the neuroimage itself, which can contain enough facial features to re-identify an individual. To sufficiently de-identify an individual, the neuroimage pixel data must also be removed. Quickshear Defacing accomplishes this task by effectively shearing facial features while preserving desirable brain tissue.},

	abstract = {The development of magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional {MRI} and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that {MRI} is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure ({BIDS}), a standard for organizing and describing {MRI} datasets. The {BIDS} standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

	abstract = {The rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to the plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the world. In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure ({BIDS}). The portability of these applications ({BIDS} Apps) is achieved by using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in one convenient package. {BIDS} Apps run on all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness of the {BIDS} standard they require little manual user input. Previous containerized data processing solutions were limited to single user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High Performance Computing systems. {BIDS} Apps overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use {BIDS} Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging algorithms.},
